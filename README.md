## First steps <a name="firststep"></a>

1. Install the required dependencies, two methods are available:  

    - First method, use the command prompt, go to the root of the project (where the `requirements.txt` file is located) and executing the following command:  

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt 
    ```

  





## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for restaurant customers to view dish compositions, including allergenic and non-allergenic ingredients. Our client, a restaurateur, wants to enhance transparency and improve customer experience by allowing them to check meal components before ordering.  

## 🔥 Key Features  
- 📝 **Menu Display**: Customers can browse the restaurant’s menu with detailed dish compositions.  
- ⚠️ **Allergen Information**: Clearly labeled allergens for each dish to help customers make informed choices.  
- 🔍 **Ingredient Breakdown**: A structured view of all ingredients, classified based on allergenic properties.  
- 📊 **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Statistical insights on dish frequency and allergen distribution using Python and Seaborn.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**: Data processing and analysis  
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data cleaning and manipulation  
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: Data visualization  
- **VS Code**: Development environment  
- **GitHub** for version control

##  Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://gitlab-mi.univ-reims.fr/mado0007/management_projet_digitaux.git
   cd management_projet_digitaux


## 📁 Project Structure  

The project is organized as follows: 
 
### 📂 **.idea/**  
- Contains project-specific settings and configurations for PyCharm.  
- Can be ignored if using another IDE.  

### 📂 **Fonctions/**  
- Stores reusable Python functions for working with datasets.  
- These functions perform operations such as:  
  - Cleaning and formatting data.  
  - Extracting relevant information.  
  - Handling allergens and food composition.  
 

### 📂 **Tests/**  
- Contains unit tests for validating different components of the project.  
- Ensures that the algorithms and functions in **Fonctions/** work correctly.  
- Uses `pytest` or `unittest` for automated testing.  

### 📂 **__pycache__/**  
- Automatically generated by Python to store compiled versions of imported modules.  
- Can be ignored and is usually not included in version control (`.gitignore`).  

### 📂 **data/**  
- Stores datasets in different states of processing.  
- **Subdirectories:**  
  - `raw/` → Contains the original datasets received from the client or external sources.  
  - `processed/` → Contains cleaned and transformed datasets ready for analysis and visualization.  

### 📂 **docs/**  
- Stores documentation, reports, and presentations related to the project.  
- May include:  
  - Project proposal.  
  - User guide for the restaurant interface.  
  - Any visualizations or findings from data analysis.  

### 📂 **scripts/**  
- Contains standalone Python scripts for various tasks such as:  
  - Data processing.  
  - Generating visualizations.  
  - Exporting reports.    

### 📄 **README.md**  
- The main documentation file providing an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.  

##  Next Steps  
- Implement an interactive User interface for customer use  
- Optimize allergen labeling for better readability  
- Enhance visualization for improved data interpretation

The dataset describes the composition of the menus offered by the City of Antibes. It details the composition of the menus by listing the different dishes that make them up and indicates the descriptive elements relating to the origin of the dishes.
