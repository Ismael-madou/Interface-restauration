#analytic product

We are a young team of data scientists and data analysts who received a request from a client.

Customer needs: A restaurant owner used our services to design a tool giving him a competitive advantage by making it easier to suggest dishes to his customers.

Our data comes from the restaurant owner himself who shares his information with us on his dishes and ingredients.

#description of database

our database is made up of two databases, namely menu data and dish data. These two bases will be joined to form the final database on which the project will be based.
